# issues
found some issue     
[Video inference stops after a certain number of frames](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/2064)   
[Inference stops on last frame after sometime](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/1223)
maybe next time has to use [yolo/Train Custom Data](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data)   
since this time I used roboflow
